**2. Capability Comparison Table: DirectQuery vs. Import**

| Feature                     | DirectQuery                                     | Import                                          | **Key Difference & Notes for PL-300**                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Storage**           | **Data resides in the source database.** Power BI only stores metadata (model structure). | **Data is imported and stored within the Power BI (.pbix) file** (cached in memory/disk).       | **Fundamental Difference:** DirectQuery = data stays in source, Import = data in Power BI. Remember this core distinction. |
| **Data Freshness**          | **Real-time or near real-time data.** Reports always reflect the latest data in the source (upon each query). | **Data freshness depends on the scheduled refresh frequency.** Reports show data as of the last refresh. | **DirectQuery = Up-to-date, Import = Snapshot.**  Data freshness is a key driver for choosing DirectQuery. |
| **Performance (Query Speed)** | **Performance heavily dependent on the source database performance.**  Slower for complex queries or slow source databases. | **Generally faster query performance**, especially for aggregations and common visualizations, as data is in-memory/optimized. | **Import generally faster *within* Power BI, but DirectQuery speed is source-dependent.** Understand performance trade-offs. |
| **Data Volume/Model Size**    | **No Power BI model size limit.**  Limited only by the source database capacity and query performance. | **Power BI model size limit applies** (Pro: 1GB, Premium: up to 400GB depending on SKU). | **DirectQuery handles very large datasets, Import has size limits.**  Dataset size is a major factor in choosing DirectQuery for massive data. |
| **Feature Set (DAX & Power Query)** | **Most DAX functionality supported.** Some DAX functions might perform differently or be unsupported depending on the data source.  Power Query transformations are generally pushed down to the source if possible. | **Full DAX and Power Query functionality available.**  Consistent and predictable behavior as Power BI engine handles all calculations. | **Import offers full Power BI functionality, DirectQuery may have limitations or different behavior.** Be aware of potential DAX/Power Query nuances with DirectQuery (though generally good support now). |
| **Data Source Compatibility** | **Limited to data sources that support query folding.**  Not all data sources are suitable for DirectQuery (performance implications). Common for databases (SQL Server, Azure SQL DB, etc.). | **Broader range of data sources supported.**  Can import from files (Excel, CSV), cloud services, web, databases, etc. | **Import offers wider data source connectivity.**  Data source type can influence the choice if DirectQuery is not performant or supported. |
| **Complexity**               | Can be more complex to optimize performance, especially with complex models or slow data sources. Requires understanding of source database performance. | Generally simpler to develop and manage, as performance is more predictable and Power BI engine is optimized for in-memory data. | **Import often simpler to develop and manage, DirectQuery needs performance optimization consideration.** Think about development effort and expertise needed. |
| **Security**                  | Data security enforced at the source database level. Power BI user permissions control access to reports, but data access is still governed by source database security. | Data security managed within Power BI after import (row-level security, workspace roles). Original data source security less directly enforced *after* import. | **DirectQuery leverages source database security, Import relies on Power BI security post-import.** Security needs might influence mode selection depending on existing infrastructure. |
| **Scalability & Concurrency**| Scalability and concurrency depend on the source database's ability to handle concurrent queries from Power BI users.  Potential for performance bottlenecks at the data source. | Power BI engine handles query concurrency well after data is imported. Scalability primarily depends on Power BI capacity (Pro/Premium). | **Import generally better for high concurrency within Power BI, DirectQuery depends on source database scalability.**  Consider user load and query frequency. |
| **Use Cases/When to Use**    | **When near real-time data is crucial.** **Very large datasets that exceed import limits.** **Underlying data is frequently changing.** **Strong, performant data source is available.** When you *must* query live data. | **For good performance and interactivity.** **Smaller to medium-sized datasets.** **Data refresh frequency is acceptable (not real-time required).** **Full Power BI feature set needed.** When performance and feature richness within Power BI are prioritized. | **Key Decision Factors:** Data Freshness, Data Size, Performance Needs, Data Source Type, and Complexity. Understand *when* each mode shines. |

| **Data Modeling**        | **Star Schema Design**                          | - Structure data into fact and dimension tables.  Improves query performance and simplifies model.                                                    | - Design your data model with fact tables (transactions, events) and dimension tables (attributes, categories). Ensure proper relationships. |
|                          | **Remove Unnecessary Columns/Tables**             | - Reduce model size and query processing by only importing and keeping essential data.                                                            | - In Power Query Editor, remove columns or tables not needed for reporting.                                                     |
|                          | **Data Type Optimization**                        | - Choose the most efficient data types (e.g., Integer instead of Text for numbers). Reduces model size and memory usage.                             | - In Power Query Editor, check and change column data types to the most appropriate and efficient types.                           |
|                          | **Calculated Tables (Use Judiciously)**         | - Use calculated tables only when necessary for data shaping or intermediate steps. Can impact refresh and query performance if overused.              | - Evaluate if calculated tables are truly needed.  Consider measures or Power Query transformations as alternatives.             |
|                          | **Optimize Relationships**                        | - Ensure relationships are correctly defined and necessary.  Avoid unnecessary or complex relationships.                                               | - Review relationships in Model View. Delete redundant or incorrect relationships. Ensure cardinality and cross-filter direction are correct. |
| **DAX Measures**         | **Efficient DAX Formulas**                      | - Write optimized DAX. Avoid row-by-row iteration (`SUMX`, `AVERAGEX` if possible alternatives exist). Use variables for readability and performance. | - Use Performance Analyzer to identify slow measures. Refactor DAX to use more efficient functions and minimize iterator functions if possible. Use variables. |
|                          | **Measure Branching (Avoid)**                   | - Minimize overly complex measures that are nested deeply or depend on many other measures. Simplify measure logic where possible.                        | - Break down very complex measures into smaller, more manageable measures.  Re-use measures where possible instead of nesting deeply. |
|                          | **Filter Context Awareness (CALCULATE)**        | - Understand and effectively leverage `CALCULATE` and filter context for efficient calculations.                                                        | - Study and practice using `CALCULATE` effectively.  Understand how filter context flows in DAX calculations.                   |
|                          | **Storage Engine vs. Formula Engine**             | - Be aware of how calculations are performed (Storage Engine is faster for aggregations, Formula Engine for complex logic). Try to leverage Storage Engine where possible. | - Design measures to leverage Storage Engine aggregations where feasible. For complex logic, Formula Engine is used, but aim for efficient formulas. |
| **Power Query (M)**      | **Query Folding**                               | - Ensure Power Query steps are "folding" back to the data source as much as possible.  Reduces data transfer and processing within Power BI.            | - Review Power Query steps. Check for "Query Folding" indicators (right-click step -> "View Query Folding"). Re-order or re-write steps to maximize folding. |
|                          | **Filtering Early**                               | - Apply filters as early as possible in the Power Query steps to reduce the amount of data loaded.                                                   | - Apply "Filter Rows" steps early in your Power Query queries, right after the "Source" step if possible.                      |
|                          | **Disable Load (Intermediate Queries)**          | - For intermediate queries used only for transformations, disable "Enable Load" to prevent unnecessary data loading into the model.                 | - In Power Query Editor, for queries used only for transformations (not directly visualized), uncheck "Enable Load" in query properties. |
| **Visualizations & Reports** | **Limit Visuals per Page**                      | - Avoid overloading report pages with too many visuals. Improves rendering performance and report load times.                                        | - Design reports with a focused number of visuals per page. Break down complex reports into multiple pages if necessary.           |
|                          | **Optimize Visual Interactions**                  | - Use "Edit Interactions" to control visual interactions and prevent unnecessary cross-filtering if not needed.                                    | - In Report View, select a visual, go to "Format" -> "Edit Interactions." Review and adjust interactions between visuals.        |
|                          | **Reduce Number of Slicers**                      | - While slicers are useful, too many can impact performance. Consider using the Filter Pane for more structured filtering in some cases.              | - Use slicers judiciously. Consider using the Filter Pane for more complex and structured filtering scenarios.                    |
|                          | **Performance Analyzer (Tool)**                   | - Use Power BI Performance Analyzer to identify slow-performing visuals and queries and diagnose performance bottlenecks.                           | - In Power BI Desktop, go to "View" tab -> "Performance Analyzer." Start recording and interact with the report to analyze visual performance. |
| **Data Refresh**         | **Incremental Refresh (Premium)**                 | - For very large datasets, use Incremental Refresh to only refresh changed data partitions, significantly speeding up refresh times. (Premium Feature) | - (Premium Capacity Required) Configure Incremental Refresh in Dataset settings within the Power BI Service. Define parameters for date filtering. |
|                          | **Optimize Gateway Performance**                  | - If using on-premises data sources, ensure data gateways are properly configured and performant.                                                     | - Review and optimize gateway server resources, network connectivity, and gateway configurations.  Ensure gateway is sized appropriately for workload. |

**2. Capability Comparison Table: DirectQuery vs. Import**

| Feature                     | DirectQuery                                     | Import                                          | **Key Difference & Notes for PL-300**                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Storage**           | **Data resides in the source database.** Power BI only stores metadata (model structure). | **Data is imported and stored within the Power BI (.pbix) file** (cached in memory/disk).       | **Fundamental Difference:** DirectQuery = data stays in source, Import = data in Power BI. Remember this core distinction. |
| **Data Freshness**          | **Real-time or near real-time data.** Reports always reflect the latest data in the source (upon each query). | **Data freshness depends on the scheduled refresh frequency.** Reports show data as of the last refresh. | **DirectQuery = Up-to-date, Import = Snapshot.**  Data freshness is a key driver for choosing DirectQuery. |
| **Performance (Query Speed)** | **Performance heavily dependent on the source database performance.**  Slower for complex queries or slow source databases. | **Generally faster query performance**, especially for aggregations and common visualizations, as data is in-memory/optimized. | **Import generally faster *within* Power BI, but DirectQuery speed is source-dependent.** Understand performance trade-offs. |
| **Data Volume/Model Size**    | **No Power BI model size limit.**  Limited only by the source database capacity and query performance. | **Power BI model size limit applies** (Pro: 1GB, Premium: up to 400GB depending on SKU). | **DirectQuery handles very large datasets, Import has size limits.**  Dataset size is a major factor in choosing DirectQuery for massive data. |
| **Feature Set (DAX & Power Query)** | **Most DAX functionality supported.** Some DAX functions might perform differently or be unsupported depending on the data source.  Power Query transformations are generally pushed down to the source if possible. | **Full DAX and Power Query functionality available.**  Consistent and predictable behavior as Power BI engine handles all calculations. | **Import offers full Power BI functionality, DirectQuery may have limitations or different behavior.** Be aware of potential DAX/Power Query nuances with DirectQuery (though generally good support now). |
| **Data Source Compatibility** | **Limited to data sources that support query folding.**  Not all data sources are suitable for DirectQuery (performance implications). Common for databases (SQL Server, Azure SQL DB, etc.). | **Broader range of data sources supported.**  Can import from files (Excel, CSV), cloud services, web, databases, etc. | **Import offers wider data source connectivity.**  Data source type can influence the choice if DirectQuery is not performant or supported. |
| **Complexity**               | Can be more complex to optimize performance, especially with complex models or slow data sources. Requires understanding of source database performance. | Generally simpler to develop and manage, as performance is more predictable and Power BI engine is optimized for in-memory data. | **Import often simpler to develop and manage, DirectQuery needs performance optimization consideration.** Think about development effort and expertise needed. |
| **Security**                  | Data security enforced at the source database level. Power BI user permissions control access to reports, but data access is still governed by source database security. | Data security managed within Power BI after import (row-level security, workspace roles). Original data source security less directly enforced *after* import. | **DirectQuery leverages source database security, Import relies on Power BI security post-import.** Security needs might influence mode selection depending on existing infrastructure. |
| **Scalability & Concurrency**| Scalability and concurrency depend on the source database's ability to handle concurrent queries from Power BI users.  Potential for performance bottlenecks at the data source. | Power BI engine handles query concurrency well after data is imported. Scalability primarily depends on Power BI capacity (Pro/Premium). | **Import generally better for high concurrency within Power BI, DirectQuery depends on source database scalability.**  Consider user load and query frequency. |
| **Limitations**             | **Source database performance bottleneck.** **Limited Power Query/DAX functionality in some cases.** **Report complexity can impact performance significantly.** **Limited data transformation capabilities within Power BI.** | **Data freshness is limited to refresh schedule.** **Model size limits.** **Initial data load can be time-consuming.** **Less suitable for truly massive, constantly changing datasets exceeding memory limits.** | **Consider limitations carefully when choosing mode.** Limitations are often trade-offs for the benefits of each mode. |
| **Use Cases/When to Use**    | **When near real-time data is crucial.** **Very large datasets that exceed import limits.** **Underlying data is frequently changing.** **Strong, performant data source is available.** When you *must* query live data. | **For good performance and interactivity.** **Smaller to medium-sized datasets.** **Data refresh frequency is acceptable (not real-time required).** **Full Power BI feature set needed.** When performance and feature richness within Power BI are prioritized. | **Key Decision Factors:** Data Freshness, Data Size, Performance Needs, Data Source Type, Complexity and **Limitations**. Understand *when* each mode shines *and* where it falls short. |

**7. Performance Optimization Techniques (Power BI)**

| Optimization Area         | Technique                                       | Description/Benefit                                                                                                                                  | Steps to Achieve in Power BI                                                                                                   |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Modeling**        | **Star Schema Design**                          | - Structure data into fact and dimension tables.  Improves query performance and simplifies model.                                                    | - Design your data model with fact tables (transactions, events) and dimension tables (attributes, categories). Ensure proper relationships. |
|                          | **Remove Unnecessary Columns/Tables**             | - Reduce model size and query processing by only importing and keeping essential data.                                                            | - In Power Query Editor, remove columns or tables not needed for reporting.                                                     |
|                          | **Data Type Optimization**                        | - Choose the most efficient data types (e.g., Integer instead of Text for numbers). Reduces model size and memory usage.                             | - In Power Query Editor, check and change column data types to the most appropriate and efficient types.                           |
|                          | **Calculated Tables (Use Judiciously)**         | - Use calculated tables only when necessary for data shaping or intermediate steps. Can impact refresh and query performance if overused.              | - Evaluate if calculated tables are truly needed.  Consider measures or Power Query transformations as alternatives.             |
|                          | **Optimize Relationships**                        | - Ensure relationships are correctly defined and necessary.  Avoid unnecessary or complex relationships.                                               | - Review relationships in Model View. Delete redundant or incorrect relationships. Ensure cardinality and cross-filter direction are correct. |
| **DAX Measures**         | **Efficient DAX Formulas**                      | - Write optimized DAX. Avoid row-by-row iteration (`SUMX`, `AVERAGEX` if possible alternatives exist). Use variables for readability and performance. | - Use Performance Analyzer to identify slow measures. Refactor DAX to use more efficient functions and minimize iterator functions if possible. Use variables. |
|                          | **Measure Branching (Avoid)**                   | - Minimize overly complex measures that are nested deeply or depend on many other measures. Simplify measure logic where possible.                        | - Break down very complex measures into smaller, more manageable measures.  Re-use measures where possible instead of nesting deeply. |
|                          | **Filter Context Awareness (CALCULATE)**        | - Understand and effectively leverage `CALCULATE` and filter context for efficient calculations.                                                        | - Study and practice using `CALCULATE` effectively.  Understand how filter context flows in DAX calculations.                   |
|                          | **Storage Engine vs. Formula Engine**             | - Be aware of how calculations are performed (Storage Engine is faster for aggregations, Formula Engine for complex logic). Try to leverage Storage Engine where possible. | - Design measures to leverage Storage Engine aggregations where feasible. For complex logic, Formula Engine is used, but aim for efficient formulas. |
| **Power Query (M)**      | **Query Folding**                               | - Ensure Power Query steps are "folding" back to the data source as much as possible.  Reduces data transfer and processing within Power BI.            | - Review Power Query steps. Check for "Query Folding" indicators (right-click step -> "View Query Folding"). Re-order or re-write steps to maximize folding. |
|                          | **Filtering Early**                               | - Apply filters as early as possible in the Power Query steps to reduce the amount of data loaded.                                                   | - Apply "Filter Rows" steps early in your Power Query queries, right after the "Source" step if possible.                      |
|                          | **Disable Load (Intermediate Queries)**          | - For intermediate queries used only for transformations, disable "Enable Load" to prevent unnecessary data loading into the model.                 | - In Power Query Editor, for queries used only for transformations (not directly visualized), uncheck "Enable Load" in query properties. |
| **Visualizations & Reports** | **Limit Visuals per Page**                      | - Avoid overloading report pages with too many visuals. Improves rendering performance and report load times.                                        | - Design reports with a focused number of visuals per page. Break down complex reports into multiple pages if necessary.           |
|                          | **Optimize Visual Interactions**                  | - Use "Edit Interactions" to control visual interactions and prevent unnecessary cross-filtering if not needed.                                    | - In Report View, select a visual, go to "Format" -> "Edit Interactions." Review and adjust interactions between visuals.        |
|                          | **Reduce Number of Slicers**                      | - While slicers are useful, too many can impact performance. Consider using the Filter Pane for more structured filtering in some cases.              | - Use slicers judiciously. Consider using the Filter Pane for more complex and structured filtering scenarios.                    |
|                          | **Performance Analyzer (Tool)**                   | - Use Power BI Performance Analyzer to identify slow-performing visuals and queries and diagnose performance bottlenecks.                           | - In Power BI Desktop, go to "View" tab -> "Performance Analyzer." Start recording and interact with the report to analyze visual performance. |
| **Data Refresh**         | **Incremental Refresh (Premium)**                 | - For very large datasets, use Incremental Refresh to only refresh changed data partitions, significantly speeding up refresh times. (Premium Feature) | - (Premium Capacity Required) Configure Incremental Refresh in Dataset settings within the Power BI Service. Define parameters for date filtering. |
|                          | **Optimize Gateway Performance**                  | - If using on-premises data sources, ensure data gateways are properly configured and performant.                                                     | - Review and optimize gateway server resources, network connectivity, and gateway configurations.  Ensure gateway is sized appropriately for workload. |
