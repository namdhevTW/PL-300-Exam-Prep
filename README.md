### Section 2: Model the Data

This section delves into data modeling within Power BI Desktop. It covers creating relationships between tables, understanding cardinality and cross-filter direction, working with active and inactive relationships, and the fundamentals of DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculations and measures.  Performance optimization at the model level and implementing Row-Level Security (RLS) are also crucial aspects of data modeling.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Relationships:** Creating relationships between tables to link related data. Understanding relationship types (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many) and cardinality.
*   **Cross-filter Direction:** Defining how filters propagate through relationships, impacting data context in visualizations.
*   **Active vs. Inactive Relationships:** Understanding default relationship behavior and when to use inactive relationships for specific analytical scenarios. Activating inactive relationships using DAX functions like `USERELATIONSHIP`.
*   **DAX Fundamentals:** Introduction to DAX, including calculated columns, measures, and understanding evaluation contexts (Filter Context and Row Context).
*   **DAX Functions:**  Learning essential DAX functions for aggregation, filtering, time intelligence, and table manipulation.
*   **Performance Optimization (Modeling):** Techniques to optimize data models for performance, including reducing model size, optimizing relationships, and efficient DAX formulas.
*   **Row-Level Security (RLS):** Implementing security at the row level to restrict data access based on user roles or attributes.

**Table 2.1: Relationship Cardinality and Cross-filter Direction**

| Cardinality       | Cross-filter Direction | Description                                                                  | Example Scenario                                                                  | DAX Implications                                                              | When to Use                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **One-to-One**    | Both, Single, None       | Each row in one table relates to exactly one row in another table.            | Customer Table & Customer Demographics Table (1:1 based on CustomerID)         | Typically less common, often indicates table merging opportunities             | When tables logically represent different aspects of the same entity, and are 1:1 |
| **One-to-Many**   | Single (from "one" side), Both | One row in one table can relate to multiple rows in another table.           | Customers Table & Sales Table (1:Many based on CustomerID)                      | Most common, filters flow from "one" side to "many" side by default           | For transactional data, hierarchies, lookup tables to fact tables             |
| **Many-to-Many**  | Both                     | Multiple rows in one table can relate to multiple rows in another table.         | Products Table & Sales Table (M:M through a Bridge/Junction table like Order Details) | Requires a bridge table, often impacts performance, bi-directional filtering possible but use with caution | When entities have many-to-many relationships, often resolved with bridge tables |

**Table 2.2: Relationship Types: Active vs. Inactive**

| Relationship Type | Definition                                                                  | Default Behavior                                                             | How to Create Inactive                                                            | How to Activate (DAX)                                                           | Use Cases                                                                          | Considerations                                                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Active**        | Relationship used by default for filtering and data propagation.             | Automatically used by Power BI for relationship traversal and filtering.      | Created by default when Power BI detects relationships.                            | No explicit activation needed, used implicitly.                                   | Most common relationships, primary data relationships, standard filtering scenarios | Avoid ambiguity by having clear active paths, can impact performance if misused |
| **Inactive**      | Relationship that is not used by default unless activated by DAX.            | Ignored by default for filtering and calculations unless activated by DAX.   | Uncheck "Active" during relationship creation/editing.                           | `USERELATIONSHIP('Table1'[Column1], 'Table2'[Column2])` in DAX measures.         | Scenario analysis, alternative relationship paths, handling multiple date relationships, historical comparisons | Requires explicit DAX activation, can make models more complex, understand context switching |

| **Static RLS**    | Roles are defined and users are directly assigned to these roles.  Filters are based on role membership. | Fixed filters applied based on the role a user belongs to.        | Users are explicitly assigned to roles within Power BI Service.       | Simpler to set up for straightforward role-based security.       | Good for smaller user bases, less dynamic user assignments.         | Scenarios where user roles are relatively static and clearly defined.            |
| **Dynamic RLS**   | Roles are defined, but filters are based on user attributes (e.g., username, email) often from a user table in the data model. | Filters are dynamically applied based on user's login credentials or attributes in the data model. | User attributes are typically managed within the data source and referenced in the data model. | More complex setup, requires DAX to implement dynamic filters and potentially a user lookup table. | More scalable for larger organizations and frequently changing user assignments. | Scenarios where security needs to be highly dynamic and user-driven, personalized data access. |

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Identify Security Requirements** | Determine who should see what data based on roles or attributes.             | N/A                                                   | N/A                                                       | Understand the granularity of security needed (row-level, column-level).      |
| **2. Define Roles**         | Create roles that represent different levels of data access.                     | Model tab -> Manage roles -> Create new roles.        | Workspace -> Security -> Row-level security -> Roles.      | Name roles clearly to reflect their access levels (e.g., "Regional Managers"). |
| **3. Implement Filters (DAX)** | Write DAX expressions to filter data for each role based on relevant columns.    | Model tab -> Manage roles -> Add filters to roles using DAX. | Workspace -> Security -> Row-level security -> Add DAX filters to roles. | Ensure DAX filters are efficient to avoid performance issues.                   |
| **4. Test Roles**          | Test role definitions to ensure they filter data as expected.                  | Model tab -> View as roles -> Select a role to test.  | Workspace -> Security -> Row-level security -> Test as role. | Thoroughly test each role with different users to validate security.          |
| **5. Publish & Manage Security** | Publish the report to Power BI Service and manage user role assignments there. | Publish report as usual.                             | Workspace -> Security -> Row-level security -> Add members to roles. | Security is managed in the Power BI Service, not within the report file itself. |
