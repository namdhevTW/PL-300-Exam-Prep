# Section 4: Deploy and Maintain Assets

This section covers deploying Power BI assets (reports and datasets) to the Power BI Service, managing workspaces, configuring data refresh, and considering gateway options for on-premises data sources. Licensing models (Pro vs. Premium) and performance optimization for deployed solutions are also crucial.

## Key Concepts (Section 4)

*   **Workspaces:** Understanding workspaces as containers for reports, datasets, and dashboards. Workspace roles and permissions for collaboration and access control.
*   **Publishing Reports:** Deploying Power BI Desktop reports to the Power BI Service workspaces.
*   **Data Refresh (Service):** Configuring scheduled and on-demand data refresh in the Power BI Service. Understanding different refresh types (full, incremental, etc.).
*   **Gateways:** Understanding and choosing between On-premises data gateway and Personal gateway for connecting to on-premises data sources.
*   **Licensing (Pro vs. Premium):** Differentiating Power BI Pro and Premium licenses and their implications for features, sharing, storage, and scalability.
*   **Deployment Pipelines:** Utilizing deployment pipelines for managing report lifecycle across development, test, and production environments (Premium feature).  Deployment pipelines streamline the process of moving content through different stages (e.g., development, testing, production), enabling better Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) practices and controlled deployments.
*   **Performance Optimization (Deployment & Maintenance):** Monitoring performance, optimizing refresh schedules, and ensuring efficient gateway configurations.

## Dataflows

*   **Dataflows Introduction:** Dataflows are self-service, cloud-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools within the Power BI service. They allow you to create reusable data preparation logic that can be used across multiple datasets and reports in Power BI. Dataflows decouple the data preparation process from individual reports, promoting data reusability, consistency, and easier maintenance.
*   **Benefits of Dataflows:**
    *   **Data Reusability:** Data preparation logic is defined once and can be reused across multiple reports and datasets, reducing redundant effort.
    *   **Centralized Data Preparation:**  Dataflows centralize data cleansing, transformation, and shaping, making it easier to manage and maintain data quality.
    *   **Simplified Report Development:** Report creators can connect to pre-processed, curated data from dataflows, simplifying report development and focusing on visualization and analysis.
    *   **Advanced Transformations:** Dataflows support advanced transformations and features, including linked entities, computed entities, and AI capabilities.
    *   **Performance Improvements:** By pre-processing data in dataflows, report performance can be improved as reports query optimized, prepared data.
 
## Content Endorsement and Certification

Power BI provides features to endorse and certify content to help users identify authoritative and reliable reports and datasets within the organization. These features are part of Power BI's governance and content management capabilities.

*   **Endorsement:**  Allows workspace admins and members with contributor permissions or above to *promote* content that is deemed ready for wider use. Endorsement indicates that the content meets basic quality standards and is recommended for consumption.
*   **Certification:** A more rigorous level of promotion, reserved for content that meets strict quality and governance standards. Certification signifies that the content is highly trusted, reliable, and officially sanctioned as *high-quality, ready-for-use* by the organization.  Certification is typically granted by central IT or a designated authority.
